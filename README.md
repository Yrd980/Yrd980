## 📌 About Me

Hi, I'm **Yrd980** — a CS graduate student, programmer, and deep thinker.
I use **Arch Linux + KDE + fish shell** and enjoy building efficient, minimal, and powerful development environments.

* 🔬 Dedicated to **AGI**
* ⚙️ Passionate about performance (AVX2, kernel tuning), reproducibility, and portable setups

> 🚀 I build with intention — small, composable tools that do one thing well.
